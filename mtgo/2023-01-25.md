# 2023-1-25 - 5c Creativity - (3-2)

Sorry, accidentally broke the decklist link. Future reports will have permalinks.

## Match 1 - varini - Merfolk - Win (2-1)

Die Roll: Won

### Game 1 - Loss

Kept a double spell pierce hand vs a creature deck. Fetched oddly to spell pierce a T1 Aether vial, but maybe should have let it resolve, fetched better, and bounced with the T3f I had in my opener. Ended up dying to beatdown and taking a ton of damage from lands due to necessary fetch+shocking due to my initial awkward fetch.

-4 Spell Pierce, +1 Boseiju, +1 Iona, +2 Nature's Claim

### Game 2 - Win

T3 opp tapped out to play Kira, as I removed their T1 play and they Counterspelled my T3 play on curve. T4 I got to play Mine + Xmog into a tapped out opponent. Would have been blown out by FoN, but didn't get punished. Archon got there.

### Game 3 - Win

Removal on curve, played a W6 and removed a Silvergill, which put it in range of their on-board Mutavault. Opp went for face, though which saved the W6. Opp went hard into the red zone, I tried to Binding, which got them to tap out for counterspell. Next turn I drew xmog, played mine, and went for it. Iona on blue. Drew a T3f to bounce their Master of the Pearl Trident, and Iona walled until I found another Creativity to clinch the game.

## Match 2 - jibeta - 4c Creativity (Persist+Reunion) - Loss (1-2)

Die Roll: Won

### Game 1 - Win

Mull to 5. Time walked by upkeep Ice. Persist + Bitter Reunion (thank god for spell pierce). Went for Creativity X=1 while opp had a fetch up so I could keep up pierce. opp bolted, I pierced back, but that let them Creativity 1 on their turn. Sac'd a dwarf, and just attacked the next turn. Kept mana up, opp conceded.

-1 Boseiju, -1 Fable, -3 Prismatic Ending, -2 Prismari Command, +2 Hallowed Moonlight, +4 Leyline of the Void, +1 Emrakul

### Game 2 - Loss

Mull to 5 again, kept Pierce, Pierce, Binding. A convoluted set of turns where I fetched for 5c, but if I had fetched double blue I would have had 2 pierces up to pierce the persist opp defended with 3 mana. Eventually fell too far behind and got titaned/archoned.

### Game 3 - Win

Decided not to change up boarding, but potentially should have brought in Veils. Edit after the game: I definitely should have brought in Veils.

Fetched Raugrin+Ziatora's since I had 2 Leyline Binding in hand, but prob shoudl have fetched Ketria instead of Ziatora so I could have UW on different lands for that T3f I ended up drawing, since I had a Blood Crypt in hand for black. Good to learn. Leyline Binding slowed them down a LOT, but their IoKs/CoBrus slowed me down quite a bit too (Took 2 Spell Pierces, Creativity, and T3f). Opp managed Creativity X=2, I could only binding one, and hit titan and blew up 3/4 of my lands. Titan got there before I could rebuild.

### Afterthoughts

I didn't see any Hallowed Moonlight which I think would have definitely skewed things in my favor, but maybe not with the amount of hand disruption my opp had in this game. Definitely should have brought in my Veils.

## Match 3 - werdwood93 - Burn - Win (2-0)

Die Roll: Lost

### Game 1 - Win

Mull to 6. Goblin Guide did Goblin Guide. Clutched a X=1 after opp tapped out for some damage to face w/ a Swiftspear, but they started directing fire at the Archon. This gave me enough breathing room to dwarf beatdown until I could W6+W6+Bolt+Bolt to burn them out 10-0 in one turn.

+1 Iona, +2 Claim, +1 Boseiju, -2 T3f, -2 Wrenn

### Game 2 - Win

Kept a weird 7 with Forest + Boseiju, really expecting moon or Eidolon. Got rewarded, blew up Eidolon #1 on T2 without losing life w/ Boseiju+Forest, and had enough life to take damagwhile killing Eidolon #2 with a Prismari command and making a treasure. That let me Creativity to get some health back and wall off their Firewalker.

### Afterthoughts

Would go down on either a Fable or another Wrenn to bring in a second Boseiju, I think.

## Match 4 - Nyife - 5c Creativity (Kinda Mirror, Fire//Ice+Persist) - Loss (0-2)

Die Roll: Won

### Game 1 - Loss

Mirror, but opp was on Jetmir+Xander for their 5c triomes. Opp removed all tokens. Lots of removal in their list. Tried to binding them off of tokens+Fables, but their binding forced my Raugrin, letting them Creativity X=2 for free.

-3 Prismatic Ending, -1 Prismari Command, +2 Hallowed Moonlight, +2 Nature's Claim

### Game 2 - Loss

Early W6 which opp spent binding on leaving my fable alone. Got to the point where I could hard cast, but stupidly discarded Archon to Fable the same turn. Had some fun binding back and forths, but I ended up running out of gas while my opponent drew the cards they needed to pressure me out. Eventually my opponent beat me to death with an Archon as I drew my Natures' Claims.

### Afterthoughts

I need to play tighter.

## Match 5 - Fugate - 4c Control - Win (2-0)

Die Roll: Won

Playing for entry fee back!

### Game 1 - Win

What the fuck opens with Polluted Delta? Murktide? They didn't pierce my T2 W6, so that was nice. Ketria Triome, Hallowed Fountain and no Pierce? Rhinos? Fetched double blue just in case. Saw Dress Down, so not rhinos. Just 4c control? Hard countered my Fable so they're scared of something. Trying to play patient to find a T3f. Playing patiently let me eventually slam back to back turns of creativities, eventually getting one archon down, all while my W6 ticked up to Ult range. Was able to ult W6, and burn opp out with SP backup.

+3 Veil, +1 Emrakul, -3 Prismatic Ending, -1 Prismari Command

### Game 2 - Win

Opp missed land drops and was cycling shark typhoons and flame blitzes looking for lands. I put him quickly into the ground.
